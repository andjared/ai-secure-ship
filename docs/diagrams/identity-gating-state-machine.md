# Conversation / Identity-Gating State Machine

Starting reference, copied from `SecureShip-5Week-Program.md` Section 6.2. This is the most important diagram in the program — the actual contract the backend must enforce (implemented in Week 2).

```mermaid

    [*] --> Anonymous

    Anonymous --> Anonymous: General chat / FAQ
    Anonymous --> CollectingIdentity: User asks about a shipment

    CollectingIdentity --> CollectingIdentity: Partial info given
    CollectingIdentity --> IdentityRejected: Info doesn't match any customer
    CollectingIdentity --> CodeSent: Full info matches a customer record

    IdentityRejected --> CollectingIdentity: User retries
    IdentityRejected --> Anonymous: User gives up / changes topic

    CodeSent --> AwaitingCode: Modal shown to user
    AwaitingCode --> Verified: Correct code entered
    AwaitingCode --> AwaitingCode: Incorrect code (attempt < max)
    AwaitingCode --> CodeExpired: Too many attempts OR timeout

    CodeExpired --> CollectingIdentity: User restarts verification

    Verified --> Verified: Shipment queries scoped to verified customer_id ONLY
    Verified --> [*]: Session ends / times out
```
